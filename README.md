# DA280A (Spring 26) - [Web Development I](https://mau.se/sok-utbildning/kurser/DA280A) @ [MAU](https://mau.se/en/)
This is my very first web development course on univeristy level, however it overlaps a lot with my high school education. The main purpose of me taking this course is to be availablet to participate in more advanced courses in the future such as a course in PHP and JavaScript frameworks. This course teaches basic HTML and CSS for making simple websites.
